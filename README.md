## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsiveness.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, interactivity, and state management. The code is architected using the Module Pattern for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **Tribute.js:** For the autocomplete feature.
- **Font Awesome:** For icons.
- **Google Fonts:** For the "Inter" typeface.
- **canvas-confetti:** For the celebratory achievement effect.

## üöÄ Getting Started

No complex setup is required! Since this is a pure front-end application, you can run it directly in your browser.

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**
2.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Double-click the `index.html` file, or open it with your web browser of choice (e.g., by dragging the file into the browser window).

That's it! The application will be running locally in your browser.

## üì¶ Pushing to GitHub

To push your project to GitHub, follow these steps:

1.  **Initialize a Git repository:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  **Add all files to the staging area:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Commit the files:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
4.  **Create a new repository on GitHub.**
5.  **Add the remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <repository-url>
    ```
6.  **Push the files to the repository:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

## üèóÔ∏è Code Architecture

The JavaScript code is organized using the **Module Pattern** to encapsulate logic and avoid polluting the global namespace. The main `RoutineApp` module is composed of smaller, single-responsibility modules:

-   **`ThemeManager`:** Handles theme switching and persistence.
-   **`DataManager`:** Manages loading from and saving to `localStorage`, as well as data import/export.
-   **`Gamification`:** Controls points, streaks, and achievement logic.
-   **`QuoteManager`:** Manages the daily quote feature.
-   **`TaskManager`:** Handles all CRUD operations for tasks.
-   **`DragDrop`:** Manages the drag-and-drop functionality.
-   **`ModalManager`:** Controls the behavior of all modals.
-   **`TimeManager`:** Updates the date and time display.

This clean architecture makes the code easy to read, debug, and extend.

## üîí Security

The application follows client-side security best practices:

-   **Input Sanitization:** All user-provided content (task titles, descriptions) is sanitized before being rendered to the DOM to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
-   **Error Handling:** Data parsing from `localStorage` is wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential data corruption.
